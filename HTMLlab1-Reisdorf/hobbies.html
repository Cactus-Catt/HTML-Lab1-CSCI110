<p>In addition to rodeo, video games and spending time with my family; I like to garden, indoors and outdoors! My favorite indoor plants are succulents and cactus's and my favortie outdoor plants are sunflowers and pansy's.</p>
  
<p>I also enjoy making pixel art on GIMP as well as digital photography. My "photography" consists mostly of my kids, my plants and our horses.
